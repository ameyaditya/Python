#Tuples
#tuples are similar to lists
#tuples are not mutable
t = ("hello", 3, 4.2)
#anything kind of datatype can be included in a Tuples and can be indexed
#tuples have a few different methods compared to lists
#lists have much more methods than tuples,
#so we cannot insert or remove in and out of a tuple and are not sortable
