#errors in python
#python has two types of errors
#syntax errors and exceptions

print(1)
int(9)
int 9
print(2)
print 3
#the above code is going to give an error
#this is useless, it is for core beginners.....
#line 3 has an error 'int' is a fucntion, so we need to add parenthesis
#line 5 has an error 'print' is a function and token it to be passed inside parenthesis

#exceptions in python
a=1
b= "2"
print(int(2.5)
print(a+b)

#in line three the print function doesnt have a closing bracket, so we get an error in line 4 with
#a statement is in in correct posisiton.
print(int(2.5))

#now we get an error in line 5 as we are trying ot add a integer and a string type of variable.
#exceptions are runtine errors
#this is a exception so the previous code is actually executed
#print(a+int(b)) or print(str(a)+b)
